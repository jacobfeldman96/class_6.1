# Class 6.1 - Data Visualization

The class began with a recap of Monte Carlo Simulations. We reviewed the final exercise from Thursday's class. MC simulations are used for prediction based off of the statistical analysis of historical data sets. MC simulations, however, are not necessarily very accurate with volatile stocks. Rather, they are a tool to be used for portfolio optimization when forecasting stable companies' stocks. 

Next we moved to PyViz which is the "one stop shop for data visualization." PyViz is an opened sourced library, as well as like anaconda in its structure but specifically for visualization tools. This allows end users to engage with data via multiple parameters: to filter or aggregate info. Further, it allows users to dive effectively as deep as they want, into the presented data.

Career advice. Know which type of graph to use when providing visualized data. Time series or growth data are best shown by a line graph. Bar charts are best used for data with seasonality or continuous distribution. Scatter charts are best used for correlation between two comparators. 

The class then took part in a Kahoot game which unfortunately is not available to ghost viewers. Questions were asked about API's, Sharpe Ratios, HTTP, the difference between Postman and Python - the ability to develop SDKs, the similarity between Postman and Python - the utilization of API keys, and MC simulations' utility - namely for making sense of risk. 

The class ended with a review of HVPlot which is part of PyViz and a few activities. hvplot.pandas is one of the functionalities of HVPlot which is a graph library that displays interactive statistics. It is comprised of Matplotlib, a static graph, Pandas, panel data frames whence the data for visualization is pulled and Streamz, an interactive interface which puts the cherry on top. 

I was having difficulty installing all of the processes and specifically got stuck on the widget installation process. I was, unfortunately, unable to complete the class exercises. I did, however, follow along and will complete the exercises once I have completed the installation process, which I plan on doing this evening with a TA's help during office hours.
